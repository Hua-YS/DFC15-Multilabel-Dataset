# DFC15-multilabel-dataset: a dataset for multilabel classification of remote sensing images

DFC15 multilabel dataset is produced from [GRSS_DFC_2015](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/2015-ieee-grss-data-fusion-contest/). Details are introduced in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11245.pdf). In total, there are 3342 aerial images (2673 training and 669 test) and 8 object labels. The size of each image is 600 x 600 pixels. The proposed dataset is now available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TKGS6TIRxQ6a7gdaj0cHs-mRCtv_J1HA).
